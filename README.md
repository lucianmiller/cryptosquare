## Description

Ever wanted to send a secret message to your friends? This program can help you with that! It utilizes a classic encoding method called the square code. The square code will remove all punctuation and spaces from the message that is written, and make all the letters lower case. The letters will be arranged in a square(or rectangle) formation. The coded message is gotten by reading down the columns from left to right, and grouping 5 letters together in order to get the encoded text. Try it yourself! This webpage was used to practice everything I've learned so far.
